# 🎓 University of Michigan Projects — CSE 231  

This repository contains my completed assignments and programming projects for **CSE 231: Introduction to Programming I** at the **University of Michigan**.  

These projects mark the beginning of my programming journey — where I learned to break problems into logic, write clean Python code, and fall (occasionally headfirst) into the world of software development.  



## 🧠 What This Repository Includes  

📘 **`Michigan_projects.ipynb`**  
A collection of Python-based tasks and problem-solving exercises focused on building core programming logic.  

📗 **`CSE_231_Michigan_projects.ipynb`**  
Structured assignments from the course, emphasizing algorithmic thinking, loops, conditionals, and data handling — all implemented in Python.  



## 🧩 Concepts Covered  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional logic and control flow  
- Loops and iterative design  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Lists, strings, and dictionaries  
- File handling and basic algorithms  
- Problem decomposition and testing  



## 💡 What I Learned  
- How to think like a programmer — not just code like one  
- Writing readable, modular Python scripts  
- Debugging, testing, and improving logic efficiency  
- Turning textbook exercises into real, structured code  



## 🐍 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / IPython  



## 🖋️ Reflection  

This course was where I learned the *art of logic*. Every `for` loop, every off-by-one error, and every working output felt like unlocking a new level.  
It’s not just where my code started — it’s where my mindset did.
